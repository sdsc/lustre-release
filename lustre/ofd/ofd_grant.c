 *
 * This file provides code related to grant space management on Object Storage
 * Targets (OSTs). Grant is a mechanism used by client nodes to reserve disk
 * space on OSTs for the data writeback cache. The Lustre client is thus assured
 * that enough space will be available when flushing dirty pages asynchronously.
 * Each client node is granted an initial amount of reserved space at connect
 * time and gets additional space back from OST in bulk write reply.
 *
 * This file handles the core logic for:
 * - grant allocation strategy
 * - maintaining per-client as well as global grant space accounting
 * - processing grant information packed in incoming requests
 * - allocating server-side grant space for synchronous write RPCs which did not
 *   consume grant on the client side (OBD_BRW_FROM_GRANT flag not set). If not
 *   enough space is available, such RPCs fail with ENOSPC
