/**
 * OFD interval callback.
 *
 * The interval_callback_t is part of interval_iterate_reverse() and is called
 * for each interval in tree. The OFD interval callback searches for locks
 * covering extents beyond the given args->size. This is used to decide if LVB
 * data is outdated.
 *
 * It finds the highest lock (by starting point) in this interval, and adds it
 * to the list of locks to glimpse.  This is because lock ahead creates extent
 * locks in advance of IO, and so breaks the assumption that the holder of the
 * highest lock knows the current file size.  So we must glimpse every lock
 * and merge their LVBs.
 *
 * Note that it is safe to glimpse only the 'top' lock from each interval
 * because ofd_intent_cb is only called for PW extent locks, and for PW locks,
 * there is only one lock per interval.
 *
 * \param[in] n		interval node
 * \param[in,out] args	intent arguments, gl work list for identified locks
 *
 * \retval		INTERVAL_ITER_STOP if the interval is lower than
 *			file size, caller stops execution
 * \retval		INTERVAL_ITER_CONT if callback finished successfully
 *			and caller may continue execution
