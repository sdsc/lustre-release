BUILDING LUSTRE
---------------

To build the server components, you must already have a Lustre-patched kernel,
which is outside of the scope of this document.  It is possible to build
Lustre clients against unpatched kernels.  For more information on this
process, see the web sites below.  Also consider downloading a pre-packaged
Lustre kernel and utilities from http://downloads.whamcloud.com/

To build:
  sh autogen.sh
  ./configure [--with-linux=/usr/src/kernel_tree if not in a "normal" location]
  make

To play with Lustre (will format a simple test filesystem using loop devices):
  cd tests
  sh llmount.sh

To clean up:
  sh llmountcleanup.sh
