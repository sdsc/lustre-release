.SH NAME
ll_decode_linkea \- display parent FID of a Lustre file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ll_decode_linkea
.I file
.RI [ "file ..." ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ll_decode_linkea
decodes and prints the Lustre parent FID, which is stored in the
"trusted.link" attribute on Lustre file. This is accessible to
.B ll_decode_linkea
not only through Lustre client, but also when the MDT filesystem
is mounted locally as type ldiskfs for maintenance.
.PP
The "trusted.link" extended attribute is modified when renaming or hard
link happens.
.PP
The parent FID is useful in case of MDT corruption. The fsck of ldiskfs can
recover most of the ldiskfs hierarchy, but it might put some files or
directories under lost+found. The parent FIDs can be used to determine the
right Lustre paths to move them to.
.SH EXAMPLE
.fi
root@mdt1# cd /mnt/mdt/lost+found
.fi
root@mdt1# ll_decode_linkea file1 file2
.fi
file1: count 2
.fi
    pfid[0]: [0x200034021:0x2:0x0]
.fi
    pfid[1]: [0x200034021:0x1:0x0]
.fi
file2: count 1
.fi
    pfid[0]: [0x200000007:0x1:0x0]
.PP
This shows that the 2 files in lost+found. ll_decode_linkea prints all of the
parent FIDs of these files. file1 has two parent direcotry, so it has two hard
links. Command
.B lfs fid2path
could be used to extract the paths of the parents.
.PP
Since "trusted.link" xattr is accessible on Lustre client too,
.B ll_decode_linkea
could also be used on Lustre client.
