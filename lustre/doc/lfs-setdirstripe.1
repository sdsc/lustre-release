.SH NAME
lfs setdirstripe \- used to set striping pattern of a directory.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs setdirstripe <--count|-c stripe_count>
\fB [--index|-i mdt_index] [--hash-type|-t hash_type]
\fB [--default_stripe|-D ] [-m mode] <dir>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
.B lfs setdirstripe [OPTIONS] <dir>
Create a striped directory with striping parten.
.TP
.B lfs setdirstripe -D [OPTIONS] <dir>
Set default striping parten of the directory. All of the sub-directories
created under this directory will use the striping partern. Currently, only
default stripe_count is supported.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \\--count=COUNT
Stripe over COUNT MDTs.
.TP
.B \\--mdt_index=START_MDT_INDEX
Stripe from the MDT, whose index is START_MDT_INDEX.
.TP
.B \\--hash_type
is the hash_type of the striped directory.
-t fnv_1a_64 FNV-1a hash algorithm(default);
-t all_char  sum of characters % MDT_COUNT. (not recommended)
.TP
.B \\--default_stripe
set the default stripping partern of the directory.
.m \\--mode
is the mode of the striped directory
.SH NOTE
.PP
The "lfs setdirstripe" command is only executable by root unless
"mdt.*.enable_remote_dir_gid" is set via "lctl set_param" to be either a
non-zero GID to limit it to a single group (e.g. "operator" or "admin"),
or "-1" to allow any group to create remote directories.

The root of the file system is on MDT0000, and directories and files inherit the
MDT of their parent directory unless a different MDT is specified with this
command.

By default, only directories on MDT0000 can contain directories that are not on
the same MDT.  However, if "mdt.*.enable_remote_dir" is set non-zero on an MDT
then it will allow creating remote directories that have parents other than
MDT0000. This is restricted to avoid creating directory trees that have
intermediate path components on a series different MDTs and become unavailable
if any of the intermediate MDTs are offline.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ lfs setdirstripe -c 2 -i 1 -t all_char /mnt/lustre/dir1
This creates a directory striped on two MDTs, whose first stripe is
located on the MDT1, and whose hash type is all_char.
.SH BUGS
Default stripe cannot be changed or deleted once it is set.
