.TH LFS-MIGRATE 1 2015-12-07 "Lustre" "Lustre Utilities"
.SH NAME
lfs migrate \- migrate file or directory between MDTs or OSTs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs migrate
\fI-m mdt_idx\fR [-v|--verbose] \fI<DIR>\fR
.br
.B lfs migrate
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fI<FILE | DIR>\fR...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Move MDT inodes or OST objects between MDTs and OSTs respectively. For the
case of MDT inode migration: 
.TP
.B migrate -m|--mdt-index \fI<mdt_idx> <directory>\fR
.br
Move the file metadata from one MDT to MDT with index \fBmdt_idx\fR.
Migration of striped directories is not supported. Only the root
user can migrate directories. Metadata migration of files does not succeed
if the file is part of the HSM system or the file is open. In the event that
one or more files in a directory being migrated has been involved in HSM
activity, the file will be skipped. Files that are open when a migration
takes place will also be skipped. Access to file within the directory is
blocked until migration is complete.
.TP
\fIWARNING\fR
A migrated file or directory will have a new inode number and FID.  As
a consequence, migrated files are incompatible with archived HSM files and may
confuse backup tools.
.TP
For the case of OST object migration:
.TP
.B migrate [--stripe-count|-c <stripe_count>]
                 [--stripe-index|-i <start_ost_idx>]
                 [--stripe-size|-S <stripe_size>]
                 [--pool|-p <pool_name>]
                 [--ost-list|-o <ost_indices>]
                 [--block|-b]
                 [--non-block|-n]
                 \fIfile|directory\fR
.br
Migrate can also be used for OST objects. In this mode, the command has
identical options to
.B setstripe
. The difference between migrate and setstripe is that \fImigrate\fR will
re-layout the data in existing files using the new layout parameter by
copying the data from the existing OST(s) to the new OST(s). In contrast,
\fIsetstripe\fR is used for creating new files with the specified layout.
For more information, see setstripe in lfs(1).
.br
NOTE: lfs migrate has a complementary script
.B lfs_migrate
which is used to provide extra functionality when migrating file data
between OSTs and has a separate man page.
.TP
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ lfs migrate -m 0 ./testremote
Move the inodes contained in ./testremote from their current MDT to the 
MDT with index 0.
