.SH NAME
lfs ladvise \- give file access advices or hints to server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B lfs ladvise [--advice|-a ADVICE ] [--background|-b]
        \fB[--start|-s START[kMGT]]
        \fB{[--end|-e END[kMGT]] | [--length|-l LENGTH[kMGT]]}
        \fB<FILE> ...\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Give file access advices or hints to Lustre server side, usually OSS. This lfs
utility is simlar to Linux fadvise() system call, except it can forward the
advices from Lustre clients to servers.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-advice\fR=\fIADVICE\fR
Give advice or hint of type \fIADVICE\fR. Advice types are:
.RS 1.2i
.TP
\fBwillread\fR to prefetch data into server cache
.TP
\fBdontneed\fR to cleanup data cache on server
.RE
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-background
Enable the advices to be sent and handled asynchronously.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-start\fR=\fISTART_OFFSET\fR
File range starts from \fISTART_OFFSET\fR.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-end\fR=\fIEND_OFFSET\fR
File range ends at (not including) \fIEND_OFFSET\fR.
This option may not be specified at the same time as the -l option.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-length\fR=\fILENGTH\fR
File range has length of \fILENGTH\fR. This option may not be specified at the
same time as the -e option.
.SH NOTE
.PP
Typically, the "lfs ladvise" forwards the advice to Lustre servers without
guaranteeing what and when servers will react to the advice. Actions may or
may not triggered when the advices are recieved, depending on the type of the
advice as well as the real-time decision of the affected server-side
components.

A typical usage of ladvise is to enable applications and users with external
knowledge to intervene in server-side cache management. For example, if a
bunch of different clients are doing small random reads of a file, prefetching
pages into OSS cache with big linear reads before the random IO is a net
benefit. Fetching that data into each client cache with fadvise() may not
be, due to much more data being sent to the client.

The main difference between Linux fadvise() system call and ladvise is that
fadvise() is only a client side mechanism that does not pass the advice to the
filesystem, while ladvise can send advices or hints to Lustre server sides.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ lfs ladvise -a willread -s 0 -e 1048576000 /mnt/lustre/file1
This gives the OST(s) holding the first 1GB of \fB/mnt/lustre/file1\fR a hint
that the first 1GB of the file will be read soon.
.TP
.B $ lfs ladvise -a dontneed -s 0 -e 1048576000 /mnt/lustre/file1
This gives the OST(s) holding the first 1GB of \fB/mnt/lustre/file1\fR a hint
that the first 1GB of file will not be read in the near future, thus the OST(s)
could clear the cache of the file in the memory.
.SH AVAILABILITY
The lfs ladvise command is part of the Lustre filesystem.
