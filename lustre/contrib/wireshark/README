Instructions for Building Lustre/LNet Wireshark Support
-------------------------------------------------------

Pre-requisits:

- source tree for Wireshark (recommend version 1.6.8)
- build Wireshark according to the instruction in the source tree.
- install Wireshark (usually "make install")

Building Lustre/LNet Dissectors:

- edit the Makefile in the same directory as this README.
- change this line to reflect where your Wireshark source tree is:

INCS = -I$(HOME)/wireshark-1.6.8 `pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0`

- change this line to reflect where the Wireshark plugin directory is:

PLUGIN_DIR  = /usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/1.6.8

- save the Makefile after these changes.
- run "make".  (you may need to be "root" for this as it will try to copy the
  dissectors to the Wireshark plugin directory.

As long as the make builds with no errors, you should have the dissectors built
and installed for your version of Wireshark.

To verify that the plugins are installed:
- run wirewhark (typing "wireshark" from the command line is usually good
  enough).
- Select "About Wireshark" from the Help menu.
- Click on the "Plugins" tab of the About window.
- Look in the list for the Lustre and LNet plugins.

If they are there, the plugins are installed.  If not, something went wrong
in the build process.

Note:  You can use tcpdump to capture packets on an Ethernet network, or
ibdump to capture packets on an Infiniband network.  Tcpdump is usually already
installed on most Linux distros.  You can get ibdump from this link:
